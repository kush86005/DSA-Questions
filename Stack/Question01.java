    /*Stack Underflow:- It occurs when you try to pop an item from an empty stack or try to peek at the top of an empty stack.
    It's an error condition that happens when there are no elements to remove from the stack but an operation is still attempted.*/

    /* Stack Overflow occurs when you try to push an element onto a stack that is already full.
    In other words, if the stack's capacity is reached and an attempt is made to add more elements, this leads to an overflow condition.

    In a fixed-size stack, such as one implemented with an array,
    once the number of elements exceeds the size of the array, you can't add any more elements, resulting in stack overflow.*/
