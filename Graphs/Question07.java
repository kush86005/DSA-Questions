    /*Topological Sort is a way of arranging the vertices of a directed graph in a linear order such that
    ➡️ for every directed edge u → v, vertex u comes before vertex v in the order.*/

    /*👉 Topological Sort can be applied only on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
      because, If there is a cycle, then there’s no valid way to arrange the nodes —
      you’d keep going in circles.*/

                                                A → D

      Then a valid topological order could be: A, B, D, C
